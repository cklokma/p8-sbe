This repository contains the source used to build the P8 and Centaur SBE
(Self-Boot Engine) binaries available in the 'open-power/hostboot-binaries'
repository.  This code is posted purely as a reference and without any further
support.

* The build system used to create the binaries is proprietary and
  unable to be open-sourced.
* The 'open-power/p8-pore-binutils' is a fork of upstream binutils that
  supports the architecture of the SBE.

The P9 SBE is available fully as open-source at 'open-power/sbe'.
